# Segmentation_saggital_images
Segmentation of hernias and protrusions in saggital projection of MRI-spine images

First things first, it's my first serious project in DL. For this project, I recieved a dataset contained not-processed images of spine MRI.\ 
Over all I manually made 100 images with segments of spine and its tumors - hernias and protrusions in VIA. Consequently, I made binary masks for\
semantic segmentation and made a DL model that solves this problem.

Also, you can loot at my kaggle account, where I posted whole markuped Dataset.
